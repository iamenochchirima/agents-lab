# Runtime

Owns turn lifecycle, action selection, retries, cancellation, and terminal outcomes.
It asks the context module for a bounded request, invokes the model module, and routes
approved actions through tools. It must not construct prompt context, implement provider
transport, or know which Lab scenario or experiment requested a run.
